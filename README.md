This project is a prototype based on the https://thenextweb.com/ page.

Here are the objectives for this project:
* Create a responsive design website
	* We created two different breakpoints to achieve this; one at 1024px and the other at 768px screen width
* Use HTML semantics
	* To achieve this we divided the page in different sections with articles within them
* Align elements using float and flex

This is also part of the Odin project curriculum ["BUILDING WITH RESPONSIVE DESIGN"](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-responsive-design)
